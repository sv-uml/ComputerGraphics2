# ScrumGram

This project aims to build a scrum board that can be used to organize various tasks based on their completion status. The general workflow is:

1. Use a sticky note to record a new task
2. Move it from `To Do` to `In Progress` when the task is actively being worked upon.
3. Once the task is complete, move it from `In Progress` to `Done`

In order to use the application, perform the following steps:

1. Upon app startup, point to the sticky note and use the click gesture to select it
2. Drag it to the `To Do` column and use the click gesture to "drop" it
3. Point to the sticky note and use the click gesture to open the "edit" page
4. Click on the green pencil icon to open the virtual keyboard
5. Type the description for the task and hit the "Enter" button
6. Click on the message preview to save the message
7. Point and click on a sticky note to drag it across columns/stages
