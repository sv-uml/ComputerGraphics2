# Declaration

The following was my initial plan:
1. Build a backend server along with a database that stores all task details
2. Design the Hololens app in a way that makes use of gestures to move tasks
3. Use depth effects to "pop-out" each task card

I was unable to meet these goals due to time constraints and other difficulties I faced while using Unity.

In order to build a base application, I borrowed the framework available at https://github.com/HoloLensStuff/HoloBoard.

The following modifications were made:
- Sound effects were removed to have a base version without "bells-and-whistles"
- C# scripts were rewritten to help understand the logic that was being used to understand hand gestures and move between scerens
- Sticky notes were modified (experimented) to help understand how Unity assets were developed
- Scrum board was experimented with and altered to show different designs
